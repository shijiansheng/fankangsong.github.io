# ditto
`ditto` inspired by [flatdoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/) is a markdown code
documentation system, capable of producing documentation similar to
[Three.js][1] and [Backbone.js][2]. It is designed for people who use Github
Pages to host their code documentation, but it can easily be adapted for other
use cases (it only consists of html, css, and javascript after all).

- No build process needed
- Deployable via GitHub Pages
- Easily customizable (**No bloated Twitter Bootstrap**)
- Can fetch more than just the README file
- Just create an HTML file, create some markdown files and deploy! :)

Live Demo [**here**](http://chutsu.github.io/ditto)

## Features
- **NEW Github Search**! (on your gh-pages)
- Auto-generation of Page Anchors
- Edit button to Github pages
- Scroll back to top button
